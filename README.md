# What is GRWikiEdits ?

GRWikiEdits is a script that goes through a [list of the IP addresses used by the Hellenic parliament](https://db-ip.com/all/195.251.32) and checks if any have made edits on wikipedia. 

Eventually it'll be adapted to post a tweet when twitter approves my developer account.

## Notes:

While this code appears to be working at the moment, it uses sub-optimal practices and is likely to break in some cases.   
If you want something reliable, adapt [this](https://github.com/ruebot/gccaedits-ip-address-ranges) to your needs.
